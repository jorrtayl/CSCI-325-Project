Description: Allows the user to navigate through a map and gain / lose stats as such: health, sanity, and intellect. Events are placed on the map that the player will walk on, activing the event. The event in place asks the player a question and if they get it right, they gain intellect but if it is wrong they lose health.

Currently an Observer Design pattern is being used for this project.
